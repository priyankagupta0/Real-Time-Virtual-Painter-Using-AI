# Real-Time-Virtual-Painter-Using-AI

The Real-Time Virtual Painter Using AI is a project aimed at developing a virtual painting tool that uses artificial intelligence to track hand movements and convert them into digital paintings. The project will utilize machine learning algorithms to detect and track hand landmarks, which will then be used to draw on the screen in real-time.

The virtual painter uses a simple hand gesture interface, where two fingers is used for selection and one finger is used for drawing. The user can select the desired color and the system will then detect the selected color and use them to draw on the screen.

The project is developed using Python and OpenCV for hand tracking and detection. The project also leverages real-time processing capabilities to provide users with a seamless painting experience.

This project aims to provide a fun and interactive way for users to express their creativity and explore digital painting using AI technology. The real-time painting tool will allow users to see their paintings come to life in real-time, making the experience more engaging and immersive.
